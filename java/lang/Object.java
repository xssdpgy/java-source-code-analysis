     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of
     *     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
     * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal

     * Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning
     * of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
     * intent is that, for any object {@code x}, the expression:

     * <pre>
     * x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
     * will be true, and that the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, but these are not absolute requirements.
     * While it is typically the case that:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
     * {@code super.clone}.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except

     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
     * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
     * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
     * by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this means
     * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
     * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
     * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
     * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
     * need to be modified.
     * <p>
     * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
     * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
     * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
     * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
     * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
     * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
     * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
     * whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an
     * exception at run time.

     * 在其他线程调用此对象的 notify() 方法或 notifyAll() 方法前，导致当前线程等待。换句话说，此方法的行为就好像它仅执行 wait(0) 调用一样。
     * 当前线程必须拥有此对象监视器。该线程发布对此监视器的所有权并等待，直到其他线程通过调用 notify 方法，或 notifyAll 方法通知在此对象的监视器上等待的线程醒来。然后该线程将等到重新获得对监视器的所有权后才能继续执行。
     * Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the

     * The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread
     * releases ownership of this monitor and waits until another thread
     * notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor to wake up
     * either through a call to the {@code notify} method or the
     * {@code notifyAll} method. The thread then waits until it can
     * re-obtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution.
     * <p>
     * As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are
     * possible, and this method should always be used in a loop:
     * <pre>

     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. See the {@code notify} method for a
     * description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
     * a monitor.

     * 该方法一般由 JVM 自动调用，一般不需要程序员去手动调用该方法。
     * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
     * determines that there are no more references to the object.
     * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java&trade; virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
     * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
     * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * {@code Object} may override this definition.
     * <p>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p>
     * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
     *
     * @throws Throwable the {@code Exception} raised by this method
